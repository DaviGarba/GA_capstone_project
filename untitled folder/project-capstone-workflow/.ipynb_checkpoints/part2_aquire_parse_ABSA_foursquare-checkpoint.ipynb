    "Ideal Data vs. Available Data Often times we start by identifying the ideal data we would want for a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the data acquisition phase, we'll learn about what data is available and any limitations it may have. We'll decide if these limitations will inhibit our ability to answer our question or if we can work with what we have to find a reasonable and reliable answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some typical questions at this stage may include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying the right data set(s)\n",
    "Is there enough data?\n",
    "Does it appropriately align with the question/problem statement?\n",
    "Can the dataset be trusted? How was it collected?\n",
    "Is this dataset aggregated? Can we use the aggregation or do we need to get it pre-aggregation?\n",
    "Assess resources, requirements, assumptions, and constraints\n",
    "Further, we'll need to acquire the data by:\n",

    "Importing data from the web (Google Analytics, HTML, XML)\n",

    "Check: Why might it be important to understand how data was collected?\n",
    "\n",
    "A data dictionary is exactly what it sounds like - it's a set of documentation that explains what our data is and how it is formatted. Here is an example:\n",

    "Location | Planet of the company | Categorical\n",
    "Days Since Last Delivery | Integer | Continuous\n",
    "Number of Deliveries | Integer | Continuous\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Tasks at this step include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading any documentation provided with the data (e.g. data dictionary above)\n",
    "Performing exploratory surface analysis via filtering, sorting, and simple visualizations\n",
    "Describing data structure and the information being collected\n",
